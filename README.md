# Welcome to ShellOS

**ShellOS** is a Linux Distribution created from scratch, using:

- Our custom created Shell
- Our custom creatd init
- Our custom created tools, which include:
  - cd
  - ls
  - rm
  - rmdir
  - cat
  - echo
  - mkdir
  - minifetch
  - reboot
  - poweroff

Every program that we've just listed is created in the **C** programming language

## Getting Started

- Grab the [ShellOS](https://github.com/ENux-Distro/ShellOS/releases/download/ShellOS-1.0/ShellOS.iso) ISO
- We recommend you test this on a VM **without EFI**.
- After booting, you can test our commands, and when you are done, close the VM
